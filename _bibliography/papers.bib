      abstract={A search for the resonant production of a heavy scalar X decaying into a Higgs boson and a new lighter scalar S, through the process X→S(→bb)H(→γγ), where the two photons are consistent with the Higgs boson decay, is performed. The search is conducted using an integrated luminosity of 140 fb−1 of proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The search is performed over the mass range 170 ≤ mX ≤ 1000 GeV and 15 ≤ mS ≤ 500 GeV. Parameterised neural networks are used to enhance the signal purity and to achieve continuous sensitivity in a domain of the (mX, mS) plane. No significant excess above the expected background is found and 95\% CL upper limits are set on the cross section times branching ratio, ranging from 39 fb to 0.09 fb. The largest deviation from the background-only expectation occurs for (mX, mS) = (575, 200) GeV with a local (global) significance of 3.5 (2.0) standard deviations.},

collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS
detector during Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider.
   
   All the searches for beyond Standard Model physics presented in this
thesis contain beauty  quarks from the decay of Higgs bosons or top
quarks. These particles are detected using the so-called b-tagging
algorithms which are trained using simulated events and therefore need
to be calibrated in data. A search for the supersymmetric partner of the
top quark and two searches for beyond the Standard Model Higgs
bosons are presented. The nature of these beyond the Standard Model
particles is strongly influenced by the breaking of the supersymmetry or
electroweak symmetry, respectively. Hence the title, The Beauty in
Broken Symmetries, nicely encompasses the work that is presented in
this thesis},

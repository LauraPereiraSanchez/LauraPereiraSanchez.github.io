I hold a PhD in experimental Particle Physics from <a href='https://www.fysik.su.se/english/elementary-particle-physics'>Stockholm University</a>, supervised by <a href='https://www.su.se/english/profiles/strandberg-1.188090?open-collapse-boxes=research-projects'>Prof. Sara Strandberg</a>. I have more than 6 years of experience as a Researcher and Data Scientist in the <a href='https://atlas.cern/Discover/Collaboration'>ATLAS Collaboration</a> - an international Collaboration with more than 3000 physicist and engineers from different research labs and universities. We work together to build one of the biggest particle physics detectors in the world and analyze its data. My main role consists on **developing software exploiting AI and statistical analysis** for testing different hypothesis comparing data and simulation.

Early in my PhD, I focused on developing technical expertise and contributing to collaborative projects. As I gained experience, I took a more active role in leadership and project management. By my third year, I was entrusted with managing two key projects. In my final year, I wrote a research proposal that was awarded the prestigious <a href='https://kaw.wallenberg.org/en/calls/wallenberg-foundation-postdoctoral-scholarship-stanford-university-usa'>Wallenberg Postdoctoral Fellowship</a>. This not only demonstrated my strategic vision but also secured the funding for my current position as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Stanford University with <a href='https://profiles.stanford.edu/caterina-vernieri?tab=bio'>Prof. Caterina Vernieri<a/>. I also work closely with <a href='https://makagan.github.io/kagan/'>Dr. Michael Kagan<a/>, applying **state-of-the-art Machine Learning techniques** to the collaboration. We are currently exploiting transformers and differentiable programming to integrate physics knowledge into neural network models for particle physics. I am also working on **building** a **new** particle physics **detector** that will be installed at CERN in 2026.

I am deeply goal oriented and have a great ability to collaborate. I enjoy both, being the hands-on expert of a small part of a project, but also overseeing and organizing the requirements of a full project. My colleagues often describe me as efficient, driven and an excellent communicator.

My interests extend beyond particle physics. I have exploited my experience training Neural Networks with highly imbalanced datasets in particle physics to contribute to a publication about long term detection for autonomous driving, performed in collaboration with engineers at Scania and KTH.

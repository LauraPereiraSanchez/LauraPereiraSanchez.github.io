I hold a PhD in experimental Particle Physics from <a href='https://www.fysik.su.se/english/elementary-particle-physics'>Stockholm University</a>, supervised by <a href='https://www.su.se/english/profiles/strandberg-1.188090?open-collapse-boxes=research-projects'>Prof. Sara Strandberg</a>. I have more than 6 years of experience as a Researcher and Data Scientist in the <a href='https://atlas.cern/Discover/Collaboration'>ATLAS Collaboration</a> - an international Collaboration with more than 3000 physicist and engineers from different research labs and universities. We work together to build one of the biggest particle physics detectors in the world and analyze its data by developing AI and statistics based softwares.

Currently, I am a <a href='https://wallenbergresearchlink.stanford.edu/people/laura-pereira-sanchez'>Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford University</a> with <a href='https://profiles.stanford.edu/caterina-vernieri?tab=bio'>Prof. Caterina Vernieri<a/> and <a href='https://makagan.github.io/kagan/'>Dr. Michael Kagan<a/>.

I am deeply goal oriented and have a great ability to collaborate. I enjoy both, being the hands-on expert of a small part of a project, but also overseeing and organizing the requirements of a full project. My colleagues often describe me as efficient, driven and an excellent communicator.

My interests extend beyond particle physics. I have exploited my experience training Neural Networks with highly imbalanced datasets in particle physics to contribute to a publication about long term detection for autonomous driving, performed in collaboration with engineers at Scania and KTH.
